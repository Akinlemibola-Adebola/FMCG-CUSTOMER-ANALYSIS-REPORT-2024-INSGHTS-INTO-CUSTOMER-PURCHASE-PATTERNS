# INTRODUCTION
FMCG is an e-commerce firm that delivers variety of products to customers in different states across the U.S. This analysis looks closely at customer purchase patterns to understand customer preference and improve customer loyalty.

# Objectives
- The main aim is to conduct detailed analysis on customer behavior, generate actionable insights and provide data-driven recommendations to stakeholders improving sales and customers retention.

# Problems being addressed
I aim to provide answers to the following questions;
- Which product is purchased the most by customers?
- Which payment type most customers use?
- Which product category is purchased the most?
- Which is the highest rating from customers?

# Analysis observation
- The total revenue generated from customers (50,000 total) purchase equals $4,083,386.
- Monthly Purchase Trends: Sales remain relatively stable across the months, averaging ~4,166 purchases per month. Slight dips in February (3,930) and June (4,058) suggest seasonal variations.
- Top Purchased Products: Headphones (3,261), T-Shirts (3,206), and Smartwatches (3,177) are the most purchased items. Products from Beauty, Home, and Clothing also rank high.
- Electronics (12,642 purchases) lead slightly over Home (12,492), Beauty (12,447), and Clothing (12,419). This suggests diverse customer interest across product categories.
- Old and new customers are nearly equal in number (25,244 old vs. 24,756 new). Indicates healthy customer retention and acquisition balance.
- Customer Satisfaction (Ratings): Ratings are evenly distributed, with slightly higher counts for 1-star (10,099), 4-star (10,045), and 5-star (10,029) ratings. High 1-star ratings suggest dissatisfaction in certain areas.
- Customers use Debit Cards (12,589), Credit Cards (12,528), and Cash on Delivery (12,496) almost equally. UPI (12,387) is slightly less preferred but still significant.

# Recommendations
- Address Customer Satisfaction Issues: High 1-star ratings suggest a need for improving product quality, delivery efficiency, or customer service. Also, i recommend that a cutomer feedback analysis be conducted to pinpoint areas where customers experience dissatifaction
- Enhance Seasonal Promotions: Sales dip in February and June, so targeted promotions, loyalty incentives, and limited-time discounts could boost engagement.
- Expand Top Product Offerings: Given the popularity of Headphones, T-Shirts, and Smartwatches, I recommend launching bundles, premium versions, or exclusive collections of these top products. Also, pairing lower purchased products with best sellers can help boost thier sales. 
- Optimize Payment Options: UPI transactions are slightly lower hence, partnering with payment providers for cashback or convenience offers could drive adoption.
- Improve Retention Strategies: With an almost equal split between new and old customers, personalized offers for returning customers can enhance retention.
